- 👋 Hi, I’m Melkizedek Mirasi (https://melkizedek.net/)
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and its application to develop interesting educational software.
- 🌱 As a result, I'm currently learning Python on Coursera (from Michigan University - PY4E). I finished my first Python course on Codecademy 2 years ago. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-for-education projects
- 📫 Let's get in touch via Twitter - https://twitter.com/melkizedek_
